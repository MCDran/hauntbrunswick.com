                <h3>Darker Themes</h3>
                <p>The tone is creepier, with unsettling, disturbing settings designed to heighten your sense of fear.</p>

                <h3>Jump Scares and Startles</h3>
                <p>Actors may surprise you with sudden appearances and creepy whispers, so be prepared for some heart-racing moments.</p>

                <h3>Close Encounters</h3>
                <p>Expect actors to get close, though they won’t touch you. However, you may feel—or be felt—by static props as you move through the house, adding a layer of unsettling realism.</p>

                <h3>Scarier Sound Effects</h3>
                <p>Prepare for loud, unsettling sounds—creaking doors, distant screams, and eerie noises that make you feel like something is lurking nearby.</p>
